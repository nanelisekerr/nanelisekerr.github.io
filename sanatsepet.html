  <br>
zalimin hadsiz zulmüne seçilmiş kurbanım şimdilerde<br>
tepeden tırnağa fazlalıkları üzerime zimmetlenmiş dünyanın<br>
kör düğümler atılmış şefkatle çabaladığım sonuçlara<br>
ayakkabılarıma<br>
soğuk betonlar dökülmüş adımlayacak hali kalmamış mecalimin<br>
yazık ki<br>
her gün, biraz daha gururla bakıyor aynalar derinleşen çizgilerime<br>
her gün, biraz daha sömürmekte saçlarımı kardan beyazlar<br>
yazık ki<br>
parmakalrımın arasından<br>
çözülmüş su gibi akıp gidiyor yaşamak gemleyemiyorum zamanı<br>
bilseydim<br>
deli bir tay gibi koşmazdım patikalarda<br>
nihai<br>
kaidesi değişmiyor atıl düzenin<br>
küflü bir çekmecede liyakatle<br>
yerini sağlamlaştırıyor olduramadıklarım<br>

	for annie(his best poem imo)<br>
	<br>
	Thank Heaven! the crisis,<br>
The danger, is past,<br>
And the lingering illness<br>
Is over at last—<br>
And the fever called "Living"<br>
Is conquered at last.<br>
<br>
Sadly, I know<br>
I am shorn of my strength,<br>
And no muscle I move<br>
As I lie at full length—<br>
But no matter!—I feel<br>
I am better at length.<br>
<br>
And I rest so composedly,<br>
Now, in my bed,<br>
That any beholder<br>
Might fancy me dead—<br>
Might start at beholding me,<br>
Thinking me dead.<br>
<br>
The moaning and groaning,<br>
The sighing and sobbing,<br>
Are quieted now,<br>
With that horrible throbbing<br>
At heart:—ah, that horrible,<br>
Horrible throbbing!<br>
<br>
The sickness—the nausea—<br>
The pitiless pain—<br>
Have ceased, with the fever<br>
That maddened my brain—<br>
With the fever called "Living"<br>
That burned in my brain.<br>
<br>
And oh! of all tortures<br>
That torture the worst<br>
Has abated—the terrible<br>
Torture of thirst<br>
For the naphthaline river<br>
Of Passion accurst:—<br>
I have drank of a water<br>
That quenches all thirst:—<br>
<br>
Of a water that flows,<br>
With a lullaby sound,<br>
From a spring but a very few<br>
Feet under ground—<br>
From a cavern not very far<br>
Down under ground.<br>
<br>
And ah! let it never<br>
Be foolishly said<br>
That my room it is gloomy<br>
And narrow my bed;<br>
For man never slept<br>
In a different bed—<br>
And, to sleep, you must slumber<br>
In just such a bed.<br>
<br>
My tantalized spirit<br>
Here blandly reposes,<br>
Forgetting, or never<br>
Regretting, its roses—<br>
Its old agitations<br>
Of myrtles and roses:<br>
<br>
For now, while so quietly<br>
Lying, it fancies<br>
A holier odor<br>
About it, of pansies—<br>
A rosemary odor,<br>
Commingled with pansies—<br>
With rue and the beautiful<br>
Puritan pansies.<br>
<br>
And so it lies happily,<br>
Bathing in many<br>
A dream of the truth<br>
And the beauty of Annie—<br>
Drowned in a bath<br>
Of the tresses of Annie.<br>
<br>
She tenderly kissed me,<br>
She fondly caressed,<br>
And then I fell gently<br>
To sleep on her breast—<br>
Deeply to sleep<br>
From the heaven of her breast.<br>
<br>
When the light was extinguished,<br>
She covered me warm,<br>
And she prayed to the angels<br>
To keep me from harm—<br>
To the queen of the angels<br>
To shield me from harm.<br>
<br>
And I lie so composedly,<br>
Now, in my bed,<br>
(Knowing her love)<br>
That you fancy me dead—<br>
And I rest so contentedly,<br>
Now in my bed<br>
(With her love at my breast).<br>
That you fancy me dead—<br>
That you shudder to look at me,<br>
Thinking me dead:—<br>
<br>
But my heart it is brighter<br>
Than all of the many<br>
Stars in the sky,<br>
For it sparkles with Annie—<br>
It glows with the light<br>
Of the love of my Annie—<br>
With the thought of the light<br>
Of the eyes of my Annie.<br>
	<br>
-----------------<br>
	<br>
	from "i stood tiptoe upon a little hill"<br>
	<br>
	What first inspired a bard of old to sing<br>
Narcissus pining o'er the untainted spring?<br>
In some delicious ramble, he had found<br>
A little space, with boughs all woven round;<br>
And in the midst of all, a clearer pool<br>
Than e'er reflected in its pleasant cool,<br>
The blue sky here, and there, serenely peeping<br>
Through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping.<br>
And on the bank a lonely flower he spied,<br>
A meek and forlorn flower, with naught of pride,<br>
Drooping its beauty o'er the watery clearness,<br>
To woo its own sad image into nearness:<br>
Deaf to light Zephyrus it would not move;<br>
But still would seem to droop, to pine, to love.<br>
So while the Poet stood in this sweet spot,<br>
Some fainter gleamings o'er his fancy shot;<br>
Nor was it long ere he had told the tale<br>
Of young Narcissus, and sad Echo's bale.<br>
