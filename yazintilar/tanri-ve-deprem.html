	<p><b>tanri ve deprem</b><br>
after the earthquake that almost destroyed the entire<br>
southeastern turkey i realized that fact again. more than<br>
30.000 people died and there were no god to help them.<br>
most of the people died because of cold. minus Â°C and <br>
snowy weather... and the saved ones were get saved by <br>
other people. there were no miracles or something. why <br>
did god not prevented such destruction. and after the <br>
destruction, why he didn't helped humans. is god bad? was<br>
he ever cared humans? or did the concept of "god" really<br>
existed? it does not makes sense anymore because people<br>
are died and this is not reversable. a typical beliver<br>
would say this is the test from god. but they miss <br>
important point that "are those deceased people were<br>
worthless to god?". if all this was just test for our<br>
faith, then what was his plan for those who suffered?<br>
will they get back to life? i think we all know the answer.<br>
if god really exists, i would like to say that he is a<br>
ruthless, bloodthirsty murderer who kills innocent as he<br>
wishes to his face. it is disgusting when you notice the<br>
"god" concept depends on a thing that controls everything<br>
between time and space. everything that happens is because<br>
of that "thing". what kind of creature would destroy the<br>
thing it made? i observed lot about everything around me.<br>
but didn't saw any single example of someone or something<br>
enjoys destroying what he/she made with lot of effort. they<br>
even got mad when someone else destroys it. for example, <br>
think of a fireman. their job is extinguishing the fire,<br>
not starting it. and after they extinguish the fire, if<br>
someone came and start another fire in front of their eyes<br>
he probably gets angry. he will think about making bad <br>
things to that guy even if its unethical. thats all because<br>
of that guy just destroyed his efforts. imagine a bird making<br>
its nest. if some guy came and ruined its nest the bird will<br>
probably try to attack that person. same goes for every living<br>
creature on earth. but how can the "god" who wise and creator<br>
of all things can be this merciless about ruining what he made?<br></p>
