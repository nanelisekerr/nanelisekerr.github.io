coca cola<br>
a classic. but used to be taste good. it might be only <br>
in turkey but it feels like ingridient quality decreased. <br>
anyways still drinkable 5/10<br>
->light<br>
tastes like shit. i don’t recommend it to anyone. i still<br>
remember drinking this first time when i was 8 and won’t<br>
give it another chance. 1/10<br>
->zero<br>
altough the light is bad, this one is acyually pretty good.<br>
both are non-sugar cokes but there is something different<br>
in this. and this “something” makes it better than the original <br>
one. 7/10<br>
<br>

pepsi<br>
another classic, but better. it didn’t changed as far as i<br>
remember. more acidic and less sugary than coca cola. 7/10<br>
->max<br>
best thing i’ve ever drink. cannot explain it with words. <br>
just drink it 10/10<br>
->twist<br>
lime taste has made it better than original one. it is not<br>
soury. but when you drink it you can feel the lime aroma. 8/10<br>
<br>
cola turka<br>
i swear these fuckers have found the secret recipe of coca<br>
cola. same taste but cheaper 5/10<br>
<br>
bi cola<br>
a101 version of coke. you can feel the qualityless acidic <br>
sugar in your veins 1/10<br>
<br>
le cola<br>
only sells in bim and probably the cheapest coke you can found <br>
in market. it says it won taste reward in belgium on its<br>
packaging but it seems fake. like there are many coke brands out<br>
there that really tastes good. probably they thought it is french<br>
brand because of its name and give it higher rank. too bad that<br>
awards don’t make it taste better 3/10<br>
<br>
oguz gold cola<br>
legend says it is still 0.25tl. i don’t really remember its taste<br>
but i remember after a long and tiring football games, this was <br>
like a holy water. 15/10(after football match)<br>
<br>
sariyer cola<br>
first time i drink this was in vacation. i bought it from a101<br>
but couldn’t find it in any other a101’s. really good taste. <br>
everything as it should be. it gives the taste of old coca cola. 8/10<br>
<br>
crown cola<br>
and this is the sok version of traditional cheap cokes. <br>
better than bicola, worse than lecola. 3/10<br>
